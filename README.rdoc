= Planetoid

Planetoid is a lightweight planet, for small communities who want to aggregate their feeds and projects in one single place.

I've discontinued the development of this project, but I'll leave it here as an archive.

= Dependencies

Planetoid is a rails app, so this means you need to have ruby and rails installed. You can find more info about Ruby on Rails framework on http://rubyonrails.org

Also, Planetoid requires the following gems:

* Feedzirra, to fetch the feeds. http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra
* Sluggable Finder, to generate user permalinks. http://github.com/ismasan/sluggable-finder
* Twitter, to twitt http://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter
* Bit.ly, to shorten URLs before sending them to Twitter http://github.com/philnash/bitly
* erubis, to render the .erb views http://github.com/genki/erubis

You can install these gems manually or running:

  [sudo] rake:gems:install

= Installation notes

* Copy the provided config/planetoid.yml.example as config/planetoid.yml and edit it to change the default admin login and password, or any other config settings
* Copy the provided config/database.yml.example as config/database.yml and edit it to point to your databases
* Run "rake db:migrate" to create the tables
* Launch the server and visit the site.

= Basic administration

From the initial install, you'll be prompted to create your first users and feeds. When you access these admin sections, you'll be asked for the admin login/password that you should define previously on the config/planetoid.yml file.

To identify yourself as an admin, just go to /login

= Feed parsing

Just add your feed URLs and they'll be parsed automatically when they're created.

There is a rake task that will update all the feeds, you can put this into your cron to automate it:

  rake planetoid:fetch:all

= Some Extras

* Google Analytics support. Just include your Google Analytics tracker number on the config/planetoid file and the code for Google Analytic will be included on the site (only for production environment). This number is something like UA-123456-78, you'll find it on your Google Analytics tracking code.

* Twitter integration. You can specify a twitter account to send twitts to it and notificate of new members, feeds, entries and projects.

* Bit.ly integration. You can specify your Bit.ly credentials (login and API key) so planetoid will shorten all URLs before twitting. To use this, create a Bit.ly account and get your API key at http://bit.ly/account/your_api_key
